Such accidents cause enormous consequences, the most important of which, of a human nature, is the loss of life. Other effects appear in the ride of this reality, one of which is the financial loss, due to the long traffic jams and roadblocks, which have a negative impact on the logistics of goods.\n\nIn parallel, it is necessary to contextualize the importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in solving urban problems. Given the worldwide technological advancement, cities are becoming increasingly \u201csmart\u201d. The terminology \"Smart Cities\" basically goes back to the concept of a city that makes use of ICT, through various physical devices connected to the IoT (Internet of Things) network, in order to optimize its operations and services, in addition to connecting citizens.\n\nFaced with such a problem, it is suggested the development of a mathematical model that, in view of the knowledge of initial situations, a risk classification should be carried out. From this perspective, given the driver's entry into a certain road, he is given knowledge of the degree of risk to which he will be subject and, thus, the necessary preventive measures can be taken, such as: changing his route, reducing the car speed, or increasing your attention.\n\nThus, having the knowledge of historical accident data in a given location and the creation of a mathematical model based on this data, a city could use this tool to implement data capture devices (rain, traffic, object recognition on the roads) with the purpose of issuing alerts to the drivers (electronic boards, mobile phone applications, among others).\n\nThis project aims to inform Seattle city drivers (audience) about the conditions of the road he will be joining. In this way, he will be able to analyze the situation in order to take the necessary preventive measures."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.
