# A DATA ANALYSIS OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN SEATTLE, WA
## Applied Data Science Capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate/Coursera

This project aims to build a complete report from Seattle's vehicle crash data.

In addition to the data analysis, the application of some machine learning algorithms is presented in order to predict the severity of a given accident.

This project was developed as an end-of-course project to obtain the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate / Coursera.
